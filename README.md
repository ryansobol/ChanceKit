# ChanceKit

**ChanceKit** is a Swift library for modeling probability.

## Overview

ChanceKit provides an `Expression` structure for initializing, interpretting, and deriving mathematical expressions that support probabilities. An expression may be composed of numbers, polyhedral dice rolls, arithmetic operations, and arithmetic groups. When interpretted, an expression produces a single, probablistic result. Additionally, new expressions can be derived from existing expressions.
