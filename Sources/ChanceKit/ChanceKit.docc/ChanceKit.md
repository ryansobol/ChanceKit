# ``ChanceKit``

**ChanceKit** is a Swift library for building apps and games that use probability.

## Overview

ChanceKit provides models and utilities for initializing, interpretting, and deriving mathematical expressions that support probabilities. The library provides a structure to model an ``Expression`` of numbers, polyhedral dice rolls, arithmetic operations, and arithmetic groups. When interpretted, an expression produces a single, probablistic result. New expressions that are longer or shorter in length can be derived from older ones.
